It is no surprise to anyone that the past year 2022 has seen the biggest housing bubble in US history
resulting in home prices that have pushed many first time home buyers out of the market.
The high sticker price of homes associated with higher mortgage rates has also produced 
the lowest home buyer sentiment in more than a decade according to 
[Fannie Maeâ€™s home purchase Sentiment Index](https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/surveys-indices/national-housing-survey). 

Asheville North Carolinas housing bubble has resulting in exorbitant home prices despite 
the median household income of roughly $60,000 according to the U.S. Census. For a person 
making just the median income they would have to spend 7x their annual income for $422,000 home.

This ratio, household income to home prices (price to earnings P/E), can function as an affordability metric. We can map this value
over time in Asheville to produce a picture of how housing affordability has changed over time.

The graph above uses annual wage data from the [Bureau of Labor and Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/data/),
and the median home prices from [Zillows ZHVI data series](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) which tracks home prices. 
Each data point represents average home prices and reported wages for a quarterly period in a year going back
to 2002. The fluctuations from peaks to valleys represent the seasonal differences in home values.

Until the value comes close to the average, affordability and home prices are out of reach for the
average worker in Asheville NC.
