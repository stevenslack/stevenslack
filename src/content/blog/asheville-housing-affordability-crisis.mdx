It is no surprise to anyone that the past year 2022 has seen the biggest housing bubble in US history
resulting in home prices that have pushed many first time home buyers out of the market.
The high sticker price of homes associated with higher mortgage rates has also produced 
the lowest home buyer sentiment in more than a decade according to 
[Fannie Mae’s home purchase Sentiment Index](https://www.fanniemae.com/research-and-insights/surveys-indices/national-housing-survey). 

Asheville North Carolinas housing bubble has resulting in exorbitant home prices despite 
the median household income of roughly $60,000 according to the U.S. Census. For a person 
making just the median income they would have to spend 7x their annual income for $422,000 home.

We can chart this affordability metric over time using annual wage data from the Bureau 
of Labor and Statistics, and the median home prices from Zillows ZHVI series which tracks home prices.

Wages can’t keep up with growth. Affordability will kill the AVL housing market … OR the town will 
face labor shortages as may workers look elsewhere for housing and affordability.
