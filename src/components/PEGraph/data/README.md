Data can be fetched via the BLS API as such:
https://api.bls.gov/publicAPI/v2/timeseries/data/ENU3702140010/?startyear=2013&endyear=2023&calculations=true&annualaverage=true&aspects=true

This has rate limitations and date range limitations of 10 years therefore downloadable CSV data is much more rich and reliable. This requires manual updating.
